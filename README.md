# Action-Detection
End-to-end pipeline for multi-person action detection using YOLO-Pose for keypoint extraction and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for sequence classification. Supports real-time video/webcam inference, ONNX export, and safety-critical actions like fall detection.

## üìå Features
- **YOLO-Pose (Ultralytics)** to extract 17 COCO keypoints per frame.  
- Temporal features: positions, multi-scale velocities/accelerations, and optional joint-angle dynamics.  
- **TCN classifier** with dilated temporal convolutions.  
- Multi-person tracking via IoU assignment.  
- Real-time visualization (bounding boxes + action label + FPS).  
- Robust fall detection logic & heuristics (safety use-cases).
